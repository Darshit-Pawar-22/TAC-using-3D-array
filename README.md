# TAC-using-3D-array
This project focuses on generating Three Address Code (TAC) for operations involving three-dimensional arrays. It translates high-level array expressions into intermediate code suitable for compiler backends. The goal is to simplify complex array indexing into a sequence of low-level, easily executable instructions.
